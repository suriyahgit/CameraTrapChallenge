# CameraTrapChallenge
(1st Iteration Completed :checkered_flag:)

## Project Goals

***1st Iteration :checkered_flag:***
1. **Identify coherent sequences of images (over time) for both Badger and Deer Dataset :ballot_box_with_check:Folder: `coherant_sequence/`**
2. **Locate the animals in the images (rough position) :ballot_box_with_check: Folder: `custom-yolov7/`**
3. **Classify the animals (badger vs. deer) :ballot_box_with_check: Folder: `custom-yolov7/`**

***2nd Iteration*** : `[**In Progress**]`
1. Extend the BDD dataset with at least 2 additional species (at least 50 images each, day or day & night) of your choice (called BDD+)
2. Locate the animals in the images (alternative method)
3. Classify the animals into the min. 4 classes (alternative method)

## Project 

Using analytical and machine learning algorithms for animal detection from terrestrial remote sensing CameraTrap data of a National Park.
