# CameraTrapChallenge
(PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT)

## Project Goals
1. **Identify coherent sequences of images (over time) for both Badger and Deer Dataset :ballot_box_with_check:**
2. **Locate the animals in the images (rough position) :ballot_box_with_check: Folder: coherant_sequence**
3. **Classify the animals (badger vs. deer) :ballot_box_with_check: Folder: custom-yolov7**
4. Extend the BDD dataset with at least 2 additional species (at least 50 images each, day or day & night) of your choice (called BDD+)
5. Locate the animals in the images (alternative method)
6. Classify the animals into the min. 4 classes (alternative method)

## Project 

Using analytical and machine learning algorthms for animal detection from terrestrial remote sensing CameraTrap data of a National Park.
